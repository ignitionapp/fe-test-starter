# Ignition Front End Coding Exercise

## Exercise
You need to build a form that validates data when submit button is pressed with all errors shown to the user as presented in the screenshot below.

We have provided some tests with this project. These tests will help you write the right zod schema to validate the form. Your task is to write the code that makes tests pass and build ui that works.

Use your imagination when building the form. If you build what is presented in the screenshot, it should be sufficient, but if you want to make it fancier - all the power to you!

<figure class="image">
  <img src="img/form.png" alt="Example form">
  <figcaption>Example form</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure class="image">
  <img src="img/form-errors.png" alt="Example form with errors">
  <figcaption>Example form with errors</figcaption>
</figure>

## Your Code Submission
Your solution must be submitted in the form of a CodeSandbox link. Clone this project to start coding away.

If you choose to code directly in CodeSandbox, there's nothing else for you to set up.

If you prefer to work on localhost in your IDE, we leave it to you to figure out all the setup steps. Just keep in mind that **final solution must be presented via CodeSandbox**.

**All code you submit must be in TypeScript**.

## Useful info
[Ignition](https://ignitionapp.com) developers use [React](https://react.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) (RHF) and [Zod](https://zod.dev/) every day. In this coding exercise you'll be using all of these tools. Basic scaffolding has been set up for you so you can hit the ground running.

This is an "open book test" - feel free to learn as you go by browsing documentation and any resource you can find on the web.

Try to make as many tests pass as you can, but don't be discouraged if you can't do it all.

This exercise may feel very specific with the tools we chose to work with. We did this so you can get a taste of what Ignition Engineers are dealing with. If this is your cup of tea, we'll be happy to chat with you.
